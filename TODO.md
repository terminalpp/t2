# Features

- would be nice to have a way for the tpp to issue notification that the terminal will display using the OS 
- make sure that hypertext clicking has always precedence over mouse capture in the application (or maybe make hotkey enabled mouse to always go to app or some such)

# TODO

- maybe have stream that provides the simple basics and then have a reader that wraps around it and provides the extra functions? 
- rewrite sequence parsers to use readers so that we can use them for the buffered / unbuffered ones and so on
